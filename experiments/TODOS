* Look at the other datasets discussed during meeting (exploratory).
* Implement Gossip learning or BrainTorrent and benchmark against that.
* Benchmark under different node failures and stuff like that (also pick out 50/90/95/99th percentile models)
* Test running against different data biases.
* Implement FedAdagrad/FedYogi or FedAdam: https://arxiv.org/pdf/2003.00295v3.pdf  --> Maybe not in the first hand
