* Look at the other datasets discussed during meeting (exploratory).
*** Acute inflammation dataset: Dataset is to small. Data is linearly seperable, so might not be super relevant. However, could be interesting to run an FL with failures on
    it to check if it can still find the "optimal" logistic reg model. However should not be a starting point.

*** NN5 data: Need to heavy models, literally going to take weeks to train multiple models of it. Could do a smaller experiment on it though.

    Literally moving average is one of the best models.
    Literally the only feature is a scalar. If we need to do time series, probably use Rossman: https://www.kaggle.com/c/rossmann-store-sales/data?select=train.csv
* Implement Gossip learning or BrainTorrent and benchmark against that.
*** Gossip learning: MergeNone works like way better then MergeAverage... --> Make sense
*** BrainTorrent: TODO: For benchmarking.
* Benchmark under different node failures and stuff like that (also pick out 50/90/95/99th percentile models)
* Test running against different data biases.
* Implement FedAdagrad/FedYogi or FedAdam: https://arxiv.org/pdf/2003.00295v3.pdf  --> Maybe not in the first hand
